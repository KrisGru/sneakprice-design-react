> Design, presenting the home page of a shoe shop. The aim was to write code from photoshop project and learn about responsiveness - no transitions to other pages and no site mechanics. For example, after searching for a shoe, the event displays an alert include "Your nike is waiting for you in another shop". 
> Live demo [_here_](https://sneakprice.herokuapp.com/).
